# Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-Project
In this Project, we analyzed data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We analyzed the risk of the stock, based on the previous performance history. The analysis between the correlation between the different stocks' closing prices and stocks' daily returns is shown visually. We also predicted future stock prices using Monte Carlo Method. Some of the questions answered in this project are : 1. What was the change in price of stock over time? 2. What was the daily return of stock on average? 3. What was the moving average of various stocks? 4. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular risk? 5. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?  .
